# Greeting-
## Project Overview
The Greeting Cards App is a React-based project designed to create and showcase personalized greeting cards for various occasions. This app allows users to select templates, customize messages, and share their creations. The primary goal of the project was to practice React fundamentals, including component-based architecture, state management, and props usage, while creating a fun and engaging application.

## Objectives:
Build a user-friendly interface for designing greeting cards.
Implement reusable components to streamline development.
Enhance React skills, including state management and hooks.
Learn to handle form inputs and conditional rendering effectively.
What I Learned:
During the development of this project, I gained a deeper understanding of React components and their lifecycle. I also improved my skills in managing application state with React's useState and useEffect hooks. Additionally, I learned how to implement dynamic styling and conditional rendering to create a more interactive user experience.

## Discussion
Working on this project was both challenging and rewarding. Creating reusable components for the card templates and ensuring seamless user interactions required thoughtful design and testing. One of the most enjoyable aspects was seeing the app come together as a functional and visually appealing product. Debugging and optimizing performance taught me valuable problem-solving skills, and overall, this project strengthened my confidence in building React applications from scratch.
